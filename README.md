# Firestone-Idle-RPG-Autoclicker
This was made with the intention to improve my QoL when idling in Firestone Idle RPG. 
Comes with an autoclickers that targets the centre of the window as well as a skill spam that allows efficient farming with hero characters that have powerful 3rd skills. 

# Hotkeys
Hotkey|Function|
|----------------|-------------------------------
|Ctrl+Q|Starts autoclicker (Preferrably for climbing levels)|
|Ctrl+E|Starts 3rd skill spam (For blaze's efficient farming) |

>Take note that 3rd skill spam will constantly activate the firestone window 

# How to use
Just simply double click this script once Firestone is running and hit either of the hotkeys as desired

*when it comes to the third skill spam, to deactivate it, you might need to input ctrl + e at the exact same time*

> Feel free to use and modify this script however you'd like to suit your needs, this does act as a framework and a kind of learning experience with autohotkey and scripting in general.
